<h1>Lichess Games Analyzer</h1>

<p>This repository implements a MapReduce program to help analyze data from a Lichess profile</p>

<h2>How to use:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download lichess game data from the <a href="https://database.lichess.org/">Lichess Open Database</a></li>
  <li>Run the <code>ProcessPGN.py</code> script to convert the PGN data into input for the MapReduce program
    <br /> (Alter the values of <code>PROCESSES</code> and <code>PER_PROCESS</code> to control the level of parallelization and number of games considered)</li>
  <li>Place all files generated by <code>ProcessPGN.py</code> into your HDFS to use as input</li>
  <li>Compile <code>ProcessUnits.java</code> and run it</li>
  <li>Extract the output file from the HDFS and place it in the same directory as the <code>Chess.ipynb</code> notebook</li>
  <li>Run the singular cell in the notebook and input the Lichess username for which statistics are desired</li>
  <li>Statistics will be generated for the user and the PGNs of all games lost by that user will be output to <code>lost.pgn</code> for review</li>
</ol>

<p>As an example, statistics have been generated for the Lichess user EricRosen</p>
